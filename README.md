### Polish Olympiad in Informatics
This repository contains my solutions of problems presented in Polish Olympiad in Informatics.  
  
The purpose of this is to help me understand algorithmics and improve my programming skills.  
  
Not all solutions are solutions for the maximum number of points. If you spot a mistake or know how to improve some solution, I would be grateful for pulling a request.  
  
All problems written in Polish can be found here: https://szkopul.edu.pl/task_archive/oi/
